Warning: Flutter support for your project's Kotlin version (1.9.22) will soon be dropped. Please upgrade your Kotlin version to a version of at least 2.1.0 soon.
Alternatively, use the flag "--android-skip-build-dependency-validation" to bypass this check.

Potential fix: Your project's KGP version is typically defined in the plugins block of the `settings.gradle` file (C:\Users\madha\OneDrive\Desktop\Attendance-App\flutter_application\android/settings.gradle), by a plugin with the id of org.jetbrains.kotlin.android. 
If you don't see a plugins block, your project was likely created with an older template version, in which case it is most likely defined in the top-level build.gradle file (C:\Users\madha\OneDrive\Desktop\Attendance-App\flutter_application\android/build.gradle) by the ext.kotlin_version property.

lib/features/leave/mobile/views/leave_mobile_view.dart:302:26: Error: The getter 'isDark' isn't defined for the type '_LeaveMobileViewState'.
 - '_LeaveMobileViewState' is from 'package:flutter_application/features/leave/mobile/views/leave_mobile_view.dart' ('lib/features/leave/mobile/views/leave_mobile_view.dart').
Try correcting the name to the name of an existing getter, or defining a getter or field named 'isDark'.
